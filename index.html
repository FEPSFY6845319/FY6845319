    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="ex1">
        Concrete is one of the most essential materials in most construction applications, concrete is typically formed
        from cement, sand and gravel and water. It has its best uses in foundations; pathways and roadways; bridge and
        tunnel work; and many more. However, both at a commercial and domestic scale there is a massive issue with
        modern concrete: deterioration. This issue is estimated to have a cost of $100 billion per annum worldwide
        (Chen, 2004), to highlight the problem, about half of schools built in the UK only about 50 years ago need
        permanent repair work or outright replacement of whole structures (Department for Education, 2021).
        This conference project will discuss why concrete has this problem, alternatives to modern concrete, past and
        new, and whether these alternatives are feasible.

    <h2 id="Deterioration-of-Concrete">Deterioration of Concrete</h2>
    <p class="ex1">
        Damage to concrete is often the result of many factors in conjunction over time, main ones being:
    </p>

    <!-- Subtitles under "Deterioration of Concrete" -->
    <h3 class="sub-title">Freeze-Thaw cycles:</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        If water enters small cracks in then freezes, the crack gets bigger. This is because water expands ~9%
        when it freezes. This, in turns, lets more water in when it defrosts and when it freezes over again the crack
        gets bigger, letting more water in and so onâ€¦
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">Carbonation weathering:</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        Essentially carbon dioxide in the air reacts with hydrated calcium hydroxide, (Bary, 2002), a compound in
        concrete. This leads to the formation of calcium carbonate, which lowers pH of the structure which in reinforced
        concrete- concrete with reinforcing steel aka. Rebar- destroys the oxide layer around the rebar, further 
        destroying the structure. Figure 1 shows the chemical reaction.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">Other Chemical reactions:</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        The combustion of fossil fuels lead to sulphurous gases that combine with moisture in the atmosphere,
        lowering its pH, making it into acidic rain. If concrete is exposed to acidic conditions for a long time,
        it will wear away.
        Salts and Alkalis: Salts in many forms such as de-icing salts; sodium, potassium, calcium chloride are
        mildly acidic, wearing away concrete when in solution especially. Alkalis attack concrete via alkali-silica 
        reactions. This can happen over time as highly alkaline cement paste reacts with the silica in sand or gravel
        inside concrete, producing a characteristic pattern of deterioration in concrete, as seen in figure 2.
