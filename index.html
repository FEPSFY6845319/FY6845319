    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="ex1">
        Concrete is one of the most essential materials in most construction applications, concrete is typically formed
        from cement, sand and gravel and water. It has its best uses in foundations; pathways and roadways; bridge and
        tunnel work; and many more. However, both at a commercial and domestic scale there is a massive issue with
        modern concrete: deterioration. This issue is estimated to have a cost of $100 billion per annum worldwide
        (<a href="#ref1">Chen, 2004</a>), to highlight the problem, about half of schools built in the UK only about 50 years ago need
        permanent repair work or outright replacement of whole structures (Department for Education, 2021).
        This conference project will discuss why concrete has this problem, alternatives to modern concrete, past and
        new, and whether these alternatives are feasible.

    <h2 id="Deterioration-of-Concrete">Deterioration of Concrete</h2>
    <p class="ex1">
        Damage to concrete is often the result of many factors in conjunction over time, main ones being:
    </p>

    <!-- Subtitles under "Deterioration of Concrete" -->
    <h3 class="sub-title">Freeze-Thaw cycles:</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        If water enters small cracks in then freezes, the crack gets bigger. This is because water expands ~9%
        when it freezes. This, in turns, lets more water in when it defrosts and when it freezes over again the crack
        gets bigger, letting more water in and so on…
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">Carbonation weathering:</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        Essentially carbon dioxide in the air reacts with hydrated calcium hydroxide, (Bary, 2002), a compound in
        concrete. This leads to the formation of calcium carbonate, which lowers pH of the structure which in reinforced
        concrete- concrete with reinforcing steel aka. Rebar- destroys the oxide layer around the rebar, further 
        destroying the structure. Figure 1 shows the chemical reaction.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">Other Chemical reactions:</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
        Acidic: The combustion of fossil fuels lead to sulphurous gases that combine with moisture in the atmosphere,
        lowering its pH, making it into acidic rain. If concrete is exposed to acidic conditions for a long time,
        it will wear away.
        
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">    
        Salts and Alkalis: Salts in many forms such as de-icing salts; sodium, potassium, calcium chloride are
        mildly acidic, wearing away concrete when in solution especially. Alkalis attack concrete via alkali-silica 
        reactions. This can happen over time as highly alkaline cement paste reacts with the silica in sand or gravel
        inside concrete, producing a characteristic pattern of deterioration in concrete, as seen in figure 2.

    <h2 id="Alternatives-to-Concrete">Alternatives to Concrete</h2>
    <p class="ex1">
        In the previous section it was discussed that normal concrete can deteriorate through freeze-thaw cycles 
        (that are dependant on cracks being present) or chemical weathering (that create cracks themselves and weather
        concrete and its reinforcements gradually). These failures of concrete can be minimised with the implementation
        of both old and new technologies.
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
        Starting with the old, why are ancient roman structures still intact to this day? Its because their concrete
        auto-regenerated itself! Roman cement was made from sea water and volcanic ash (Marie D. Jackson, 2013), as
        moisture entered cracks remaining volcanic ash would dissolve into it and crystalise, filling up the crack, 
        effectively healing itself. However roman concrete lacks compressive strength that modern concrete has and would
        most likely fail in most modern applications (Dove, 2021). This is where a similar, however newer, technology
        can come into play.  
    </p>
    <p class="ex1">
        Geopolymer concrete is essentially normal concrete but with fly ash and GGBS, byproducts of thermal power and
        steel plants (Mishra, 2021). It has the same property as roman concrete, being that it can heal itself, however
        it has a much higher compressive strength than even that of normal concrete
        – 28MPa (bigdreadymix, 2023) <  45Mpa (Mohd A., 2013). 
    </p>
    <p class="ex1"> 
        Another alternative to basic concrete is bacteria concrete. Essentially bacteria and nutrients are added to
        concrete, the bacteria lay dormant until exposed to moisture, this would happen when a crack forms. When the
        bacteria are activated, they start to multiply and will fill up the crack, preventing more damage via the methods
        described in the previous section.
